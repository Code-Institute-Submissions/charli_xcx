This is a website for an artist called 'Charli XcX'. The singer is well known for her music that is heavily influenced by 90s pop, electronic music, and PC Music. Charli Xcx started uploading her music on Myspace in the early 2000's. This website is goal is to evoke that era with its design while still utilizing all of the modern day features a website today would have.

The website has 5 main pages, "Home", "About", "Tours", "Reviews", and "Discography". Each tries to use its colour scheme and design to familiarise the guest with the music of Charli XcX without having even heard a song. And if a fan comes to the website to have the design and scheme on each page make sense to that fan of her music.

- ### Design
    - #### Colour Scheme

        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/LkRPsRS/Screenshot-2020-06-25-at-11-43-00.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-06-25-at-11-43-00" border="0"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/dP5Sh8g/Screenshot-2020-06-25-at-11-42-42.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-06-25-at-11-42-42" border="0"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/W2mRnpy/Screenshot-2020-06-25-at-11-42-30.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-06-25-at-11-42-30" border="0">
        
    - The 3 main colours I chose for the project was an #FC60A8 (Hot-Pink), #F2BAC9 (Millenial  Pink), & #DFD9E2(light grey). [With a touch of #7A28CB(bright purple) to pop in some instances] From the beginning of the design process, the goal was to design a bombastic and flamboyant design, but within reason. The idea of these colour choices were to create a sense of identity of who the artist is, and what their musical style is. The artist started her career on Myspace and the colours where trying to recall back to the days of customised pages on Myspace. To go along with the colour scheme are the photos of their album/single covers that follow a similar colour theme.

    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/8xwQLVq/Screenshot-2020-06-25-at-11-47-21.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-06-25-at-11-47-21" border="0">
        - Two other colours that run a consistent theme throughout the website are SILVER and #007bff(light blue). To create the late 90's Windows look. These are used to create a sense of nostalgia of the era the artist is heavily influenced by.
            
    - #### Typography
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/f8WFDBg/Screenshot-2020-06-25-at-11-49-21.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-06-25-at-11-49-21" border="0">

        - "Pixelated MS Sans Serif" is the main font that is used throughout the website. It is taken from both "98.css" and "windows-95-ui-kit" which are linked down below. This font helps create the look of the late 90s Microsoft Windows. The backup font is "arial".
         


    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/TB9qK3t/Screenshot-2020-06-25-at-11-48-58.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-06-25-at-11-48-58" border="0">

     - "'Press Start 2P', cursive" is also used for the logo/icon on each page that helps further give the nostalgia for 90's internet. The artists career originated on early Myspace so these fonts recall back to that time.


    - #### Imagery
        - Imagery was a huge factor considered throughout the  development because it envokes such a powerful impact on users eyes and brains. All of the photos used were mainly consisiting of the cover art used for the artists music. They were placed in a way to create an exciting experience for the user as is common with the artists music. Vibrant images are used to help create a sense of the artists "brash electronic pop music". Many of the images were received from looking at her [discography page on Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charli_XCX_discography)

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- #### First Time Visitor Goals
    - As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the artist.
        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a nostalgic readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Above there is a carousel with the artists albums for the user to click on if they choose.
        2. Just below the navigation buttons there is some text with a brief description of the artist. And a tip for the user to click on any of the square images to listen to the song/album. The user should easily understand this is the website for a musician.
        

    - As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.
        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the middle of each page there are navigation buttons, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly. 
        2. And at the top of the page the name of the arist to bring the user back home.
        3. Depending on the page the user is on the navigation bar will be highlighted blue to reminder the user where they are so they never are confused.
        

    - As a First Time Visitor, I want an array of information on the artist, and a good idea of what music they create.
        1. The about page has as much information as you would want about the artist and her musical influences, her early life, and the start of her career until today.
        2. The user can then go towards the tour page and see if there are any tour dates that they can see the artist perform and some information about the artists past performances.
        3. There is also a review page which showcase a wide array of different respectable music critics that praise the artists music and give a new insight to her music.
        4. And the discography is all encompassing for the artists music with a brief description of each album or EP. And clickable links of where to listen to each and tips on the top of each page that it is clickable.

- #### Returning / Frequent Visitor Goals
    - As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to have a library of all the information about the artist.
        1. There is a lot of information in the about.html page that users will be able to recall back to.
        2. For a returning visitor, there are updates for each tour date with links to the venue for the user.
        3. For a returning visitor, there are many reviews that the user can refer to when listening to the album so they can have a better insight for the music. There are reviews from respectable musical websites such as Rolling Stones, Billboard, and Pitchfork. That can be difficult to find on their own respective websites.

    -  As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to follow the artist and get information I may be interested in.
        1. On the top of each page is a link to the artists social networks.

- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone6/7/8 via iOS11.
- A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly when switching between locations.
    - And similarly, when linking to external websites.
- Mentor and family members pointed out any noticeable flaws with its design and implementation.

### Known Bugs
- Much of the styling would not be loaded with certain ad-blockers.
- On the mobile design for the discography page there the singles and features are not as centered as desired.
