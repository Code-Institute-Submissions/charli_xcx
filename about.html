						<p class="about-text">
							Charlotte Emma Aitchison was born on 2 August 1992, in Cambridge,
							England. Her father, Jon Aitchison, is a Scottish entrepreneur and
							former show-booker, and her mother, Shameera, is a Gujarati Indian
							former nurse and flight attendant who was born and raised in Uganda.
							Charli was raised in Start Hill, Essex, and attended Bishop's
							Stortford College in nearby Bishop's Stortford. While her parents
							were not very musical, she demonstrated an affinity for music from
							an
							early age, being interested in pop stars such as Spice Girls and
							Britney
							Spears. She began writing songs when she was fourteen years old,
							writing
							a song called "Fish and Chips Shop".<br><br>

												At fourteen, she convinced her parents to grant her a loan to record her
												first album, 14, and in early 2008, began posting songs from the
												album, as well as numerous other demos, on her official Myspace page.
												This caught the attention of a promoter running numerous illegal
												warehouse raves and parties in east London, who invited her to
												perform. She was billed on flyers under the stage name Charli
												XCX, which was her MSN Messenger display name when she was
												younger. Despite the illicit nature of the gigs, her parents were
												supportive of her career and attended several raves with her. In
												late 2008, while 14 was never commercially released, she released
												the two singles "!Franchesckaar!" and double A-side "Emelline"/"Art
												Bitch", under Orgy Music. She has since frequently expressed her
												distaste for her music of the time, going as far to call it "gimmicky
												dance tracks" and "fucking terrible Myspace music". At age
												eighteen, Charli moved to London to study for a fine art degree at UCL's
												Slade School of Fine Art but dropped out in her second year.

												Charli XCX says she experiences sound-to-colour
												synesthesia. She states, "I see music in colours. I love
												music that's black, pink, purple or red—but I hate music
												that's green, yellow or brown." She considers herself a
												feminist and wrote her song "Body of My Own" as a feminist
												statement. She also appeared in the 2015 documentary about
												gender equality, The F Word and Me, which premiered on BBC
												Three.<br><br>

												Charli XCX previously dated filmmaker Ryan Andrews, who
												directed numerous music videos at the start of her career,
												notably "Nuclear Seasons" (2011), "You (Ha Ha Ha)" (2013)
												and "Super Love" (2013). Since circa 2019, Charli has been
												in a longterm partnernship with Huck Kwong, whom she's dated
												before in 2014, but has been friends with since 2012. Kwong
												used to work as an A&R and they share Emmie Lichtenberg as
												mutual friends. She divides her time between London and Los
												Angeles, California.</p>

						<!-- Career Information -->
						<img src="assets/images/about/career.jpeg" class="rounded float-right img-fluid career-image" alt="Charli XcX Career Image">
						<p class="about-text">In 2010, Charli XCX was signed to Asylum Records.
							She later
							described herself as being "lost". In an interview with The
							Guardian, Charli XCX said: "I was still in school, I'd just come out
							of this weird rave scene, and I wasn't really sure what to make of
							that. And when I got signed I hated pop music; I wanted to make bad
							rap music. I didn't know who I was. I didn't know what I liked. Even
							though I was signed, I was still figuring it out."
							She released the singles "Stay Away" and "Nuclear Seasons"
							respectively, and gained attention from music website Pitchfork,
							where she earned "Best New Track" accolades for both;the former was
							eventually named to the site's "Best Tracks of 2011" list. True
							Romance was released in April 2013. It peaked at number 85 on the UK
							Albums Chart, at number five on the US Billboard Top Heatseekers,
							and at number 11 on the Australian Hitseekers Albums Chart. The
							album was received well by music critics, earning a 76/100 on
							Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from
							mainstream critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
							<br><br>

                                                Charli XCX began writing her second album in mid-2013, saying she initially wanted to go to India to record, but later decided she wanted to record in France, she said: "Two months ago, I wanted to go to India and record it, and now I want to record it in France. So I feel like nothing is definite – like, I feel very all-over-the-place at the moment. But at the moment, my heart's set on going to France and recording it, but that was different two months ago, so who knows what's going to happen?" Frustrated with the music industry, she ended up going to Sweden, isolating herself from her record label, and made a punk-inspired album over a month. Working on the album with Patrik Berger, they made it at a fast pace, saying that it is "not thought-about, everything really spontaneous [...] We don't think — it's like the first thing that comes out of my mouth is the cut on the record," however it was eventually scrapped for a more "pop"-oriented album.In early 2014, she was featured on Australian rapper Iggy Azalea's single "Fancy"; the track topped the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming both artists' first number-one single on the chart. Charli XCX expanded her portfolio of songwriting for other artists during this period, with credits on Azalea's 2014 single "Beg for It", Ryn Weaver's debut single "OctaHate", and material for acts including Sky Ferreira, Neon Jungle, Rihanna, and Gwen Stefani. In mid-2014, Charli XCX contributed the song "Boom Clap" to the soundtrack of the film The Fault in Our Stars. "Boom Clap" peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number six in the UK, and was certified platinum in Australia.

                                                In a July 2015 interview, Charli XCX said that she was working on her third album and described it as "the most pop thing, and the most electronic thing" she had ever done.
                                                On 10 March 2017, Charli XCX released the mixtape, Number 1 Angel, which featured a line-up of all female guest appearances from MØ, Raye, Starrah, Uffie, Abra, and Cupcakke and was produced largely by PC Music members including A.G. Cook, EasyFun as well as Sophie.
                                                The Number 1 Angel follow-up mixtape, Pop 2, was released on 15 December 2017, featuring collaborations with Carly Rae Jepsen, Tove Lo, Alma, Caroline Polachek, Brooke Candy, Cupcakke, Pabllo Vittar, Dorian Electra, Mykki Blanco, Tommy Cash, Kim Petras, Jay Park and MØ.
