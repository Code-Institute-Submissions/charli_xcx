										<p class="">Charlotte Emma Aitchison was born on 2 August 1992, in Cambridge,
											England. Her father, Jon Aitchison, is a Scottish entrepreneur and former
											show-booker,
											and her mother, Shameera, is a Gujarati Indian former nurse and flight
											attendant who was born and raised in Uganda. Charli was raised in Start
											Hill, Essex,
											and attended Bishop's Stortford College in nearby Bishop's Stortford. While
											her parents were not very musical, she demonstrated an affinity for music
											from an early age, being interested in pop stars such as Spice Girls and
											Britney Spears. She began writing songs when she was fourteen years old,
											writing a song called "Fish and Chips Shop".

											At fourteen, she convinced her parents to grant her a loan to record her
											first album, 14, and in early 2008, began posting songs from the
											album, as well as numerous other demos, on her official Myspace page. This
											caught the attention of a promoter running numerous illegal warehouse raves
											and parties in east London, who invited her to perform. She was
											billed on flyers under the stage name Charli XCX, which was her MSN
											Messenger display name when she was younger. Despite the illicit
											nature of the gigs, her parents were supportive of her career and attended
											several raves with her. In late 2008, while 14 was never commercially
											released, she released the two singles "!Franchesckaar!" and double
											A-side "Emelline"/"Art Bitch", under Orgy Music. She has since
											frequently expressed her distaste for her music of the time, going as far to
											call it "gimmicky dance tracks" and "fucking terrible Myspace
											music". At age eighteen, Charli moved to London to study for a fine
											art degree at UCL's Slade School of Fine Art but dropped out in her second
											year.</p>

											<h2 class="">Career:</h2>
											<p class="">In 2010, Charli XCX was signed to Asylum Records. She later
												described herself as being "lost". In an interview with The Guardian,
												Charli XCX said: "I was still in school, I'd just come out of this weird
												rave scene, and I wasn't really sure what to make of that. And when I
												got signed I hated pop music; I wanted to make bad rap music. I didn't
												know who I was. I didn't know what I liked. Even though I was signed, I
												was still figuring it out." She eventually flew out to Los Angeles
												to meet producers, and found it "wasn't working out for me" until she
												met with American producer Ariel Rechtshaid. They had a two-hour session
												and wrote the song "Stay Away". She stated that's "when things started
												to come together". Early in 2011, she was featured on the Alex
												Metric single "End of the World". She left during the second year of her
												degree course at the Slade School of Fine Art to focus on her music
												career, and in May and November 2011, she released the singles
												"Stay Away" and "Nuclear Seasons" respectively, and gained attention
												from music website Pitchfork, where she earned "Best New Track"
												accolades for both; the former was eventually named to the site's "Best
												Tracks of 2011" list.

												In addition to Rechtshaid, she began working with Swedish producer
												Patrik Berger. He sent her two beats, and she quickly wrote songs for
												each, one of which became "I Love It" and the other of which became
												"You're the One". She stated she didn't end up releasing "I Love It"
												herself as she could not reconcile it with her sound, but in 2012,
												Swedish duo Icona Pop re-recorded the song and released it as a single
												featuring her vocals. The song became an international hit, hitting
												number 1 in Charli's home country and climbing to number 7 on the
												Billboard Hot 100 in 2013. In June, she released "You're the
												One" as a single from her EP of the same name, followed by her debut
												mixtape Heartbreaks and Earthquakes, a one-track file consisting of
												eight songs including a cover of the Blood Orange song "Champagne Coast"
												and Odd Future's remix of "You're the One". In September,
												she released a video for "So Far Away", and on Halloween, she
												released a new song called "Cloud Aura" featuring Brooke Candy,
												followed by her second mixtape Super Ultra, released exclusively through
												her website in November. In early 2013, she released "You
												(Ha Ha Ha)" and announced her debut album, followed by "What I Like"
												in March.

												True Romance was released in April 2013. It peaked at number 85 on the
												UK Albums Chart, at number five on the US Billboard Top Heatseekers,
												and at number 11 on the Australian Hitseekers Albums Chart. The
												album was received well by music critics, earning a 76/100 on
												Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream
												critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". In May, she
												released a song with Welsh singer-songwriter Marina and the Diamonds,
												called "Just Desserts", followed by the video for "Take My Hand"
												later that month. </p>
